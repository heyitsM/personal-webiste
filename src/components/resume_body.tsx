            I am a passionate and aspiring softare engineer, in the process of completing a B.S. in Computer Science at 
            Johns Hopkins University. I have prior experience in backend and some frontend development. With knowledge of 
            backend frameworks such as Node/Express, Flask, and a bit of Django, and a drive to learn more, I am excited to 
            tackle new problems. Check out  
            <a href="https://emily-heyitsm.vercel.app/projects" className="hover:text-violet-800 dark:hover:text-violet-600"><b> my projects</b></a> to see examples of my work on various 
            backend projects, and some of my frontend development projects (including this one).
